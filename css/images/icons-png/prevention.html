			How can HIV be prevented?<br><br>
				•	Know your HIV status by getting tested.<br>
				•	Know your partner’s HIV status.<br>
				•	Limit your number of sex partners. The fewer partners you have, the less likely you are to encounter someone who is infected with HIV or another STD.<br>
				•	Correct and consistent latex condom use. “Natural” or lambskin condoms do not provide sufficient protection against HIV infection.<br>
				•	Do not inject drugs. If you inject drugs, you should get counseling and treatment to stop or reduce your drug use. <br>
				•	Never share needles for medications or drugs. <br>
				•	Obtain medical treatment immediately if you think you were exposed to HIV.<br>
				•	HIV-positive mothers should feed their baby formula instead of their breast-milk. <br>
				•	Having an STD can increase your risk of becoming infected with HIV or spreading it to others. So get tested and treated for STD! <br>
				•	Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP is an HIV prevention option for people who don’t have HIV but who are at high risk of becoming infected with HIV. PrEP involves taking a specific HIV medicine every day. PrEP should always be combined with other prevention options, such as condoms.
